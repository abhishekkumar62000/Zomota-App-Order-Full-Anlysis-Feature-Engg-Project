# Zomota App Order Full Analysis Feature Engineering Project 🚀

Today, I built the **Zomota App Order Full Analysis Feature Engineering Project** using **Python** 🐍 and its libraries. The goal of this project is to analyze the Zomota app order data, uncover hidden insights, and create a machine learning model that predicts key trends and behaviors from the dataset.

### 🔍 **Project Overview:**
- The project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 🔎 to identify patterns, trends, and outliers in the Zomota app order data.
- **Feature Engineering** 🛠️ is applied to create new features that enhance the model’s predictive power.
- A **Machine Learning Model** 🤖 is built using various algorithms and techniques to make predictions based on the cleaned and transformed data.

### 🧑‍💻 **Technologies & Libraries Used:**
- **Python** 🐍: The primary programming language.
- **Pandas** 📊: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy** ➗: For numerical operations and handling arrays.
- **Scikit-Learn** ⚙️: For building and training machine learning models.
- **Matplotlib** 🎨 & **Seaborn** 📈: For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook** 📓: For interactive coding and analysis.

### 🧠 **What Was Done:**
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 🔍: 
   - Explored the dataset to understand its structure and find correlations between features.
   - Cleaned the data by handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
   - Visualized trends, distributions, and patterns in the data to identify key insights.
  
2. **Feature Engineering** 🛠️: 
   - Created new features such as **order frequency**, **average order size**, and **user behavior patterns** to improve the machine learning model's performance.
   - Transformed categorical variables into numerical values and scaled features for consistency.

3. **Machine Learning Model** 🤖: 
   - Built a predictive model using **Random Forest**, **Logistic Regression**, and **Gradient Boosting** algorithms.
   - Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
   - Fine-tuned the model’s parameters to optimize performance.

### 🚀 **Outcome:**
- Gained insights into customer ordering behavior and app usage patterns.
- The machine learning model successfully predicted **order trends** with a high degree of accuracy.
- The model can be used to forecast future orders and optimize strategies for marketing and customer engagement.

### 📌 **Next Steps:**
- Experiment with advanced machine learning algorithms to improve model accuracy.
- Develop an interactive **dashboard** to visualize the insights and predictions in real-time.
- Test the model on larger datasets and real-time data for better scalability.
